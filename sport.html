										<h3 class="major">Cross Country & Athletics</h3>
										<p> I have been a proud member of Imperial's Cross Country and Athletics club representing the university in Cross Country, Road and Track races. My preferred distance on the track is 1500m and road is 5km - I did the Bristol Half Marathon once but that is way too far!</p>
										<h3 class="major">Fencing</h3>
										<p> I took up fencing when I joined Imperial and have very much enjoyed representing the university in inter-university competitions in Épée and Foil. Épée is my preferred weapon as this is what is used in Modern Pentathlon.</p>
										<h3 class="major">Modern Pentathlon</h3>
										<p> Modern Pentahlon comprises 5 disciplines: swimming, fencing, equestrianism (showjumping) and running combined with laser pistol shooting. I took up fencing when I joined Imperial and so have been able to compete in BUCS Modern Pentathlon Championships annually. My highest performance has been 4th place.</p>
										<h3 class="major">University Committee Positions</h3>
										<h4>Cross Country & Athletics - Treasurer 2019/20</h4>
										<p> As treasurer of one of the largest clubs at Imperial with over 200 members, I was responsible for, <em>inter alia</em>, budgeting, completing purchase orders and applying for grant. With an ever growing club I managed to increase our annual grant by 10%. This means that the club will be able to provide a fantastic experience for more students.</p>
										<h4>Fencing - Secretary 2018/19</h4>
										<p> As fencing secretary for the novice members of the club, I was invloved in the weekly organisation of novice sessions. This involved sending weekly emails and arranging duties for managing kit as well as leading the novice team at the annual Warwick Fencing competion. It was also my first time on a univeristy society committee and provided me with an insight that suitably prepared me for my subsequent position as treasurer of Cross Country and Athletics.</p>
